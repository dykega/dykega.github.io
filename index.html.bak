<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Gage Dykema and I am a Junior at Luther College studying Management and Computer Science.  I am originally from Northfield Minnesota and I also live in Burnsville Minnesota part time.  I spent a year before I started college attending the equivalent of senior year of high school in Lerum Sweden.  There I learned not only the Swedish language and culture, but also developed an ability to quickly adapt and learn, and also a love for traveling. Professionally I am interested in Information Security, CRM systems, and management or leadership positions within Marketing or Computer Science.  In the near future, I hope to be established in a company working hard, learning new technologies, and working at moving into a leadership position.</p>
