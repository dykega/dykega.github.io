<h1>Hello CS-365</h1>
<p>This page demonstrates a bunch of html tags.</p>

<h2>Here are some lists of things</h2>
<ol>
    <li>This is an ordered list.</li>
    <li>Add another item above this one</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>This is an unordered list</li>
    <li>Add an item below this one</li>
</ul>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>Description Lists</strong></dt><dd>Description lists contain a title and some detailed explanation</dd>
    <dt><strong>http</strong></dt><dd>Hypter Text Transfer Protocol. The language of web servers and browsers.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sometimes you want to include code that you don't want rendered by the browser.  In that case use a &lt;pre&gt; tag.</p>
<pre>
    for i in range(10):
        print("hello world")
</pre>

<p>Now, if you want to make some changes to these do the following:</p>
<pre>
    git checkout -b mychanges
</pre>
<p>This makes a local branch for you to play with.  Once you are done making the suggested changes do this:</p>
<pre>
    git commit -m 'These are my changes'
</pre>
<p>Now if you check the page in the browser you should see your changes.  To get back to my page without your changes do this:</p>
<pre>
    git checkout master
</pre>
<p>Now when you refresh your changes are gone.</p>
<pre>
    git checkout mychanges
</pre>
<p>Now they are back again.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody wants a web page without an image on it.  <img src="biker_shadow.jpg" /> Notice that there is no &lt;/img&gt; tag.  The image tag closes itself with the slash at the end as there is no reason to have anything between the open and the close.</p>

<p>Well thats a bit big.  See if you can figure out how to scale the image to a more appropriate size.</p>

<p>What makes the web great is the ability to link from one page to the next.  You can link to a page on a completely different site, like this: <a href="http://knuth.luther.edu/~bmiller/page2.html">On knuth</a></p>
<p>Or you can link to a page on the same site using a simpler reference <a href="second.html">Here</a></p>

When you are developing a web page, it is easy to run a python program as a simple web server.  Make sure your working directory is the directory that has your files in it, and then run <code>python3 -m http.server</code>  This will start a webserver on port 8000.  To bring up this page in your browser (running on the same machine) try this:  <code>http://localhost:8000/first.html</code>
