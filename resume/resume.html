<p class="no_indent">To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>In the1990's there was a management guru who heard a story about the Chicago Symphony that caught his attention.  Before this time, the Chicago Symphony was known for being a "dog orchestra" and ticket sales and memberships were declining because of it.  Then they hired a new conductor and everything turned around.  Ticket sales and memberships began to climb and the Chicago Symphony was voted one of the best symphonies in the nation.  Curious as to how this new conductor had inspired such change in his musicians the management guru set up a meeting with him.  The conductor revealed that instead of trying to instruct the whole group or the less talented portion, he only taught to the upper two percent of talent in the group.  He explained this strategy by saying that the amount of talent or skill in any organization (including his own) is distributed along a normal bell curve and that the amount of talent between any two groups of talent is fixed.  So by teaching to only the most talented of his musicians, these people in turn would pull the other musicians and the talent level of the group along with them as they learned.</p>  
<p>This is the group I want to be among in your organization and the role I want to play.  I am continually striving to learn new technologies, programming languages, and management techniques and strive to use this knowledge to push an organization forward.  My ability to learn, adapt, and innovate has been proven in my time implementing the CRM system for Luther College from the ground up and by my experience designing and developing Luther Colleges' version of Reason CMS.</p>
