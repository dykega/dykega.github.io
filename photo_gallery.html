                    <p>In the summer of 2013 my father, some family friends, and I participated in the Mud Man race at Spirit Mountain in Duluth Minnesota.  It was a very entertaining and difficult race.  The only thing that made for having to run up and down a mountain twice was that we got to do muddy obstacles every now and then.</p>

                    <p>For my class's final project in Sweden, we were given the chance to perform Pink Floyds album "The Wall".  It was an awesome experience with great music and great people.  Not only did I get to perform some songs, but I also got to listen to my classmates play some really difficult but amazing songs.  It was a perfect way to wrap up my school year in Sweden.</p>

                    <p>Another picture from Sweden, but this one is from the beginning of my stay.  This shot is from a performance we did for one of our classes.  The whole class formed groups and was told to pick and perform a song.  It was difficult for me to find a group and get to know everyone, but once I did I had the time of my life.</p>

                    <p>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a very passionate Chelsea FC fan.  So, when they came to play in the states, I had to make the trip out to Seattle with one of my friends to see it.  This was my first time seeing Chelsea play live and it was quite the experience.  I even got to see and touch the trophies!</p>

                  <p>As someone who loves to be outdoors, I am an avid water-skier, wakeboarder, and tuber when it comes to the summer.  Recently my friends and I rented a pair of paddle boards to test out on Prior Lake and as the picture shows, we were quite good at paddle boarding right from the start.</p>
